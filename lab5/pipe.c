// 2. If both ends of the pipe are closed before performing any read or write operations, any subsequent attempts
// to read or write will fail. This results in no data transfer and potential errors & abnormal termination of program.

// 3. If you attempt to both read from and write to the same pipe in the same process, it can lead to deadlocks or
// undefined behavior. The pipe is designed for inter-process communication, and such operations should be confined to separate processes.

// 4. If the parent process writes multiple times to the pipe without the child process reading, the pipe buffer
// will eventually fill up. Once full, the write() calls will block until some data is read from the pipe. 
// If the buffer size is exceeded and no read occurs, further writes will be stalled.

// 5. Synchronization Issues: Without proper synchronization (e.g., using wait()),
//  you may encounter issues where the child or parent might prematurely close or use pipe ends.
// And, In sufficient buffer memory may lead to undefined behaviour or segmentation faults,
// which doesn't allow the proccess to finish read or write processes properly.
